## Overview

### The challenge

- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Select and submit a number rating
- See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library


### What I learned

How useState works.



### Continued development

1. The rating buttons required double click to hightlight because useState resets focus, I will find a way to make it work on single click.
